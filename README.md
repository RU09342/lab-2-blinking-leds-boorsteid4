# Lab 2: Blinking LEDs

## Introduction
<q>If you can blink an LED, you can control the world!</q>

In this lab, several programs are implemented which all, in one way or another, blink an LED or a set of LEDs. While blinking an LED seems like a simple task, it is actually fundamental to understanding microprocessor programming.

## Objective
There are multiple objectives for this lab: 
<ol>
  <li>An LED must be blinked at a particular rate,</li>
  <li>Multiple LEDs must be blinked at different rates,</li> 
  <li>A LED must be mapped to and toggled by a button,</li>
  <li>An off-board LED must be controlled by the microprocessor.</li>
</ol>
